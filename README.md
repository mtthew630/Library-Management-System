# Library-Management-System

A library management system that stores books. The system stores each book title, author’s
name, 13-digit ISBN, publishing year, and edition number. It is possible to have the same title and author’s
name for a book if there are more than one edition.

Steps
- The user will be asked to input the title to start searching.
- If the program does not find a book with the requested title, the user will be asked to add this title to the
database, and he/she needs to provide all the required book information.
- If more than one book have the same title and author’s name, these records will be displayed, and the user
needs to decide which book edition to select.
- Finally, the program will display the book.
